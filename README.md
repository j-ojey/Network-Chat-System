# Network-Chat-System
```
It is an Internet chat system, based on a client/server architecture, using the Java language, and exploiting the TCP protocol.

• It allows one to connect multiple remote clients to a single
central server.
• When a user enters a text message on his/her client, the message is delivered
through the server and displayed by any other client that is currently connected to the
server, including the original sending client.
• Users can join and leave the chat at any time, provided the server is up.
• When joining, users choose nicknames, which will appear along with their
individual messages. The server address must also be specified when running
the client.
